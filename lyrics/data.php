    "Red nation"=>"Throw your muthafucking Cincinnati hats in the sky
    Nigga don't ask why
    Red laces in and out of them Air Max nine fives I,
    Walk on the moon, flow hotter than June
    Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
    Peace to my man 'Tune for giving his man room
    Now we hittin' switches to the Spring Break, Cancun
    Get it, nah forget it, soo woo I live it
    Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
    But that was suicide, I don't live in Judah's eyes
    Half of these rappers weren't trappin' when I was choppin' the do or die
    Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
    Dre called, told my baby momma won't you decide
    She chose Doc, first day I pulled Jude aside like its Aftermath for life
    And all I do is ride
    Before I turn on him I kill Satan
    And stick my red flag in the ground it's red nation!
    
    Now blood the fuck up
    Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
    And we gon' fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
    I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what
    And that's, B's up, hoes down
    Lookin' in the mirror, I'm no where to be found
    Blood, I'm a dog, call me a blood hound
    Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground
    
    Niggas'll trade they soul to be Drake or J. Cole
    Live and die for this shit, word to Tupac Shakur's halo
    One blood, plural, nigga I'm spendin' Euro's
    Ferrari got an ice cream paint job, Dorrough
    I'm up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
    Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
    We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to actin' stupid
    Get thrown in the back woods
    Los Angeles, home of the scandalous
    Pimp, hoes and gamblers
    Ninety eight degree's on Christmas
    Nigga we rollin' cannibus
    Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I'm Charles Louboutin
    The bitch fainted, pulled her panites down, stain it
    That's my Chi-lingo, yeah I'm bi-lingual
    Ball by myself nigga Ochocinco
    Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
    And everybody bleed out here, word to God

    Last train to Paris, round the world in these red Nikes
    Che Guevara of the new era, test me
    Louisville slugger, you'll get buried in my New Era
    Got that natty on tighter than a magnum
    Walk in the club saggin' with a thirty eight magnum
    Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sittin' on a hill like Lauren
    Her and the car foreign
    Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
    And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
    Where my nigga Jim Jones at?
    Roll up the weed son, so many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
    And while I'm out here, I might as well go shopping
    And put this new bad bitch I got her some red bottoms
    And all these hatin' ass niggas want me dead
    Cause I'm Malcolm X before he turned Muslim, red!
    
    Now blood the fuck up
    Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
    And we gon' fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts

    "Hallelujah"=>"Well I heard there was a secret chord
    That David played and it pleased the Lord
    But you don't really care for music, do you?
    Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
    The minor fall and the major lift
    The baffled king composing Hallelujah
    Hallelujah [x4]
    Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    You saw her bathing on the roof
    Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    She tied you to her kitchen chair
    She broke your throne and she cut your hair
    And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
    Hallelujah [x4]
    Baby I've been here before
    I've seen this room and I've walked this floor (you know)
    I used to live alone before I knew you
    And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    And love is not a victory march
    It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
    Hallelujah [x4]
    There was a time when you let me know
    What's really going on below
    But now you never show that to me, do you?
    But remember when I moved in you
    And the holy dove was moving too
    And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
    Hallelujah [x4]
    Maybe there's a God above
    All I've ever learned from love
    Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
    And it's not a cry that you hear at night
    It's not somebody who's seen the light
    It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
    Hallelujah [x13]",

    "Thunderstruck"=>"Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder
    I was caught
    In the middle of a railroad track
    I looked round
    And I knew there was no turning back
    My mind raced
    And I thought what could I do
    And I knew
    There was no help, no help from you
    Sound of the drums
    Beating in my heart
    The thunder of guns
    Tore me apart
    You've been
    Thunderstruck

    Rode down the highway
    Broke the limit, we hit the town
    Went through to Texas, yeah Texas, and we had some fun
    We met some girls
    Some dancers who gave a good time
    Broke all the rules
    Played all the fools
    Yeah yeah they, they, they blew our minds
    And I was shaking at the knees
    Could I come again please
    Yeah them ladies were too kind
    You've been
    Thunderstruck

    I was shaking at the knees
    Could I come again please

    Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck
    It's alright, we're doin' fine
    It's alright, we're doin' fine, fine, fine
    Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
    Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck
    Thunderstruck, baby, baby
    Thunderstruck, you've been Thunderstruck
    Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck
    You've been Thunderstruck",

    "Kryptonite"=>"I took a walk around the world to
    Ease my troubled mind
    I left my body lying somewhere
    In the sands of time
    I watched the world float to the dark
    Side of the moon
    I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
    
    I watched the world float to the
    Dark side of the moon
    After all I knew it had to be something
    To do with you
    I really don't mind what happens now and then
    As long as you'll be my friend at the end
    
    If I go crazy then will you still
    Call me Superman
    If I'm alive and well, will you be
    There holding my hand
    I'll keep you by my side with
    My superhuman might
    Kryptonite
    
    You called me strong, you called me weak
    But still your secrets I will keep
    You took for granted all the times I
    Never let you down
    You stumbled in and bumped your head, if
    Not for me then you'd be dead
    I picked you up and put you back
    On solid ground
    
    If I go crazy then will you still
    Call me Superman
    If I'm alive and well, will you be
    There holding my hand
    I'll keep you by my side with
    My superhuman might
    Kryptonite
    
    Oh whoa whoa
    
    If I go crazy then will you still
    Call me Superman
    If I'm alive and well, will you be
    There holding my hand
    I'll keep you by my side with
    My superhuman might
    Kryptonite
    
    If I go crazy then will you still

    "Love story"=>"When this well runs dry
    I guess you'll find another well
    When I say goodbye
    There'll be another breeze to sail
    When my boat goes down
    I guess you'll learn how to swim
    If I don't come home
    Just know you've been a good friend
    Don't forget me
    I love you so
    Don't forget me
    I've never let you go
    Don't forget me
    Love is the story I wrote
    Don't forget me
    Don't forget me
    If God is my angel, the fucking devil's the pistol
    Better put your face behind safety glass when I load up this missile
    Whistling past this infinite path, I limp when I drag
    My footprints like a giant, look at this mountain
    Bounce on my boots and then climb it
    Mount up my troupes and defiantly
    Go against what they trying
    Teach 'em to shoot when I'm rhyming
    Be living proof of my word
    Meaning I'm Bible designing
    Jesus I'm rival, decapitating put the bait on my line and
    Throw the hook to the open water
    Fish till I catch that motherfucker
    Looking for Megalodon, Goliath, Leviathan
    I have been dying to find him and tie him to my boat and chop him up
    And dine with him on a plate with a steak and a coke
    Rely on patience and hope
    Speak to a nation, it shows
    Reach through these speakers and grab you
    Turn the bass up and then choke
    And I earned my place on this road
    Ain't nobody moving me, no way
    No, how, OK, go, pow
    When I was born they said exorcise
    And the hospital set on fire
    The preacher got goosebumps when he saw me and said Messiah
    Here from the heavens, I have arose from the ashes of hell
    Brought here to be poor white trash and excel
    Stuck in the woods of 'Bama, wood like meth on the shelf
    A scientist under development with nines and twelves and threes
    And things like pyramids and fuck it you'll see
    How I made a pot of gold from a bucket of beans
    How I made it back to dry land, stuck in the sea
    From crippled ships to triple dip Z's 71's
    Yeah it's already begun
    And I ain't even had a hit but I'm fuckin' ready for one
    I got my weight up
    Like I'm carrying fat people
    I planned it, I landed
    Touch down, that Seagull
    But above all the guts glory it's more than just blood for me
    My heart is half open for the ones who never gave a fuck for me
    My love story
    Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
    Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
    Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
    Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
    Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
    Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
    Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
    Don't forget me (yeah, yeah)
    Don't forget me
    Don't forget me
    Don't forget me
    Don't forget me"
